Changelog

Version 1.1
- the number of items displayed is now limited to prevent overflow
- display estimated sum of deliveries/pickups from vehicles in the station window
- when you copy a vehicle with a set route, or when you assign an existing route to a vehicle, the average route time data is copied to that vehicle (so that the total capacity of the route is recalculated and displayed immediately)
